# Catch the Falling Object – Scratch Game

## Introduction
Catch the Falling Object is an interactive arcade-style game developed using Scratch. 
The player controls a bowl to catch falling objects and score points. 
The game demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, variables, collision detection, and random positioning.

## Objectives
- To create an interactive game using Scratch.
- To implement collision detection between sprites.
- To use variables for score tracking.
- To apply real-time keyboard controls.
- To introduce randomness for unpredictable gameplay.
- To design a continuous game loop.

## Target Users
This game is designed for students and beginners who enjoy simple yet engaging arcade games that test reflexes and coordination.

## How the Game Works
- The falling object continuously moves downward using Y-axis motion.
- The player controls the bowl using left and right arrow keys.
- When the object touches the bowl:
  - The score increases by 1.
  - A sound effect plays.
  - The object resets to the top at a random X position.
- If the object reaches the bottom, it resets to the top.

## Main Features
- Real-time keyboard control
- Continuous falling animation
- Collision detection system
- Score tracking variable
- Random object positioning
- Sound feedback
- Infinite gameplay loop

## Technologies Used
- Scratch Programming Language
- Event-driven programming
- Coordinate-based movement system

## Challenges Faced
- Preventing multiple score increases during one collision
- Adjusting falling speed for balanced difficulty
- Ensuring smooth object reset
- Debugging collision detection logic

## Solutions Implemented
- Immediate repositioning after collision
- Controlled speed using "change y by -5"
- Structured forever loops with condition blocks
- Careful testing and debugging

## Future Improvements
- Add multiple falling objects
- Add timer or countdown
- Add increasing difficulty levels
- Add background music
- Add game-over condition

## How to Run the Project
1. Open Scratch.
2. Upload the .sb3 file.
3. Click the green flag to start the game.
4. Use left and right arrow keys to control the bowl.
